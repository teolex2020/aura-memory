//! Epistemic Belief Layer — aggregates records into competing hypotheses.
//!
//! This module implements the second tier of the cognitive hierarchy:
//!   Record → **Belief** → Concept → Causal Pattern → Policy
//!
//! A Belief groups records that address the same underlying claim into
//! competing Hypotheses, scores them, and determines a winner or marks
//! the belief as unresolved.
//!
//! Currently operates in **read-only mode**: it builds and updates beliefs
//! during maintenance but does NOT influence recall ranking or policy.
